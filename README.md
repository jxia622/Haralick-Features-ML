Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting Haralick texture features from nanobubble-enhanced ultrasound images of tumors. Haralick features capture patterns and textures within the images that are often not visible to the human eye.

The extracted feature values are used to train machine learning classification models to differentiate between healthy and non-healthy tissue regions. Models such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest were employed to evaluate classification performance.

The ultimate goal of this work is to improve tumor detection accuracy in ultrasound imaging by leveraging texture-based analysis enhanced by nanobubble contrast agents.

Note: This code requires access to proprietary data from the Exner Lab and is not runnable without it. If a demonstration or further explanation is needed, please contact me via email. cxxia169@gmail.com
